## Package dependencies
Recommended to use `conda` as Python environment and package manager

1. Install (choose operating system) *either*:
    * **Anaconda** (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) if you have 600MB of free disk space and don't mind installing a large distribution of Python Data Analytics packages, *or*
    * **Miniconda** (http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) if you want to install manually the packages
    
    See http://conda.pydata.org/docs/installation.html for more information about the installation.

2. Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to replicate the virtual environment **urbansprawl**

3. Work on the **urbansprawl** `source activate urbansprawl`

4. Enjoy!
